## About

Sveltekit client/server, sanity studio, and expressjs api for my art / development portfolio, blog, and social links.

(Soon to be) live at <a href="https://kio.dev/">kio.dev</a>

## Building / running

These steps are mostly here for me - as-is, this won't build or run properly as neccesary environment vars obviously aren't present :p

### Project setup

Ensure you have npm and yarn installed, then clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiosion/portfolio ./kio-portfolio
```

### Running

Run locally:
```bash
make dev
```

Run backed by api.kio.dev:
```bash
make dev-backed
```

### Building

```bash
make prod # or make prod-backed
```
